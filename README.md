# What Is Reverse WHOIS

Reverse Whois is a tool that allows you to search for domains by the name, address, telephone number, email address or physical address of the Registrant listed in current or historical Whois records. When you perform a Reverse Whois, you will simply enter any of the Registrant's personal information and all domains with a Whois record containing that particular piece of information will be returned.
